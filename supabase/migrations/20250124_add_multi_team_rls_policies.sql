-- STEP 1: RIMUOVI LE VECCHIE POLICIES

-- Matches
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Everyone can view matches" ON public.matches;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage matches" ON public.matches;

-- Training attendance
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view training attendance" ON public.training_attendance;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Coaches can manage training attendance" ON public.training_attendance;
